    "\n",
    "1. Install [Polyglot notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) in VSCode.\n",
    "2. [Create a new Azure OpenAI service (or use an existing OpenAI service)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio#prerequisites).\n",
    "3. [Deploy the `gpt-35-turbo` and `text-embeddings-ada-002` models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#working-with-models).\n",
    "4. [Create an Azure Cognitive Search instance and enable the Semantic Search capability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/semantic-search-overview#enable-semantic-search).\n",
    "5. Copy the `.env.example` file from the parent folder to `dotnet/.env` and paste the corresponding values from the resources you provisioned in the earlier steps.\n",
    "6. Click on `Run All`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> You will need an [.Net 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [Polyglot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) to get started with this notebook using .Net Interactive"

    "## What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "Prompt engineering is an iterative approach for crafting and refining prompts to enhance interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Mastery of prompt engineering is key to unlocking the full potential of LLMs in various applications. This has been pivotal in achieving advanced use cases in Microsoft Copilots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as your go-to resource for effective prompt engineering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices: Insights from Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Be Specific and Descriptive\n",
    "Craft your prompts to be both specific and descriptive to minimize ambiguity. Using analogies or metaphors can aid in making the prompts more understandable and relatable to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Be Repetitive\n",
    "- **Repeat**: Reiterate key instructions to ensure clarity and focus in the model's output.\n",
    "- **Order Matters**: The sequence in which you present instructions can influence the model’s response due to its recency bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Efficiency\n",
    "- **Token Limitations**: Be aware of the token limits for the model you are invoking.\n",
    "- **Data Formats**: Opt for tabular formats over JSON for greater space efficiency.\n",
    "- **White Space**: Use space judiciously, as each extra space counts as a token and can limit the model's performance.\n",

    "1. Restrict\n",
    "\t> Restrict the output (e.g., choose from a confined list instead of generating free form strings)\n",
    "1. Add\n",
    "\t> Add Chain of Thought style of instruction, \"Solve the problem step by step.\"\n",
    "1. Repeat\n",
    "\t> Repeat most important instructions in the prompt a couple of times.\n",
